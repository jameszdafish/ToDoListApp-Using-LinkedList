# ToDoListUsingLinkedList
# After learning how to create a linked list, I created a to-do-list! 
    • For logging purposes, I took a little break and enjoyed Illenium's show at Merriweather Post Pavillion!
    • This project took approximately 3-4 days with only a couple hours a day.
# This is a to-do-list that includes the following features:
    • I practiced a lot with classes, methods, constructors...
    • I learned more about objects (and how they interact), variable type mastery (what I can/can't do with them), tkinter knowledge (better know-how implementation)
     
    • Create a to-do-list up to 10 TASKS (The text entries cannot exceed a certain character limit)
    • Each task has a due date and time
    • Checkbuttons to indicate completion of tasks
    • Functional buttons that...
      - Add tasks into the list
      - Edit information for each task
      - Delete a task
# Soon to come features:
    • The restriction of only numbers in the text entry boxes for dates and time
    • The ability to drag a task to a new position (I'm thinking about how to implement this, and it seems easy but implementation with tkinter sounds PAINFUL!)
